# Empty content views

If there is no content to display (e.g. no notes, no new RSS items, no files, ...) there should be a headline which says "No [items] yet". The headline should be centered vertically and above of it there should be a meaningful monochrome icon. If no icon matches, the app icon should be displayed.

Below of the headline, there can be a descriptive sentence to guide the user, like "Press the + Button to add a new [item]". If there is no floating action button, a inline button can be displayed instead.

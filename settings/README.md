# Settings

## Location

If there is a navigation drawer, the settings should be below the main navigation content and above an "About"-entry.

## Content

1. Good defaults > many configuration options
2. Add options, if many users will benefit from it, and avoid to add options which will cause much screen noise but only will help in edge cases which are not common

## Samples

Often requested options with benefit for many users are

1. Sync only on Wi-Fi
2. Dark theme
